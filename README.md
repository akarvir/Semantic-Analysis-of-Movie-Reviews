· Developed and trained model, a random forest classifier solves a binary classification problem - whether a
movie review is positive or not. Model can catch deception and sarcasm in text.

· Extracted sentiment from IMDB reviews and used weighted average to rate movies. Since the reviews cam be of varying length, I used one-hot-encoding to make sure each review in the dataset is of a consistent size.
